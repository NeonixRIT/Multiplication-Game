# Multiplication-Game
My first C# project!

I'll admit. This code is really bad. I was just getting into C# and wanted something to work on. Some tutorial video gave me the idea for a simple multiplication game and I wanted to do more with it.

At this time I had virtually no understanding of what Object Oriented Programming was but tried to implement it the best I could at the time.

I'm thinking of creating an updated version to show my progress but Umbra-Mod-Menu and my Java projects already shows my improvements.

## What it does
This is a simple multiplication game played through the console. A player starts and has health, armor, points, and abilities.
The player is given a multiplication problem each round that progressively get harder. If they get it correct then they gain points that can be spent on power ups, if they get it wrong they lose health/armour based on how wrong they were.
